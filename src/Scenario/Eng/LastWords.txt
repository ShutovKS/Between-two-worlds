end1-Thank you for passing my first game of this format. I made every effort, but, unfortunately, I worked on this project alone and do not have the skills of an artist and a screenwriter, which did not allow me to fully reveal the idea of this game. You made a choice in favor of the "Real World" and decided to take a risk by undergoing surgery. Perhaps in the distant future, a continuation of this visual novel will be released, in which I will tell you what happened next, how the relationship between the characters developed and how they overcame life difficulties.

I made every effort, but, unfortunately, I worked on this project alone and do not have the skills of an artist and a screenwriter, which did not allow me to fully reveal the idea of this game. You chose the "World of Dreams" and decided to take a risk, refusing the operation, were not afraid that your life would be cut short and everything would be in vain. Perhaps in the distant future, a continuation of this visual novel will be released, in which I will tell you what happened next, how the relationship between the characters developed and how they traveled through a mysterious world.
